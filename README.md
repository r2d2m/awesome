*   [kathleenwest/WCFStockServiceSingletonWithClientChannelFactory](https://github.com/kathleenwest/WCFStockServiceSingletonWithClientChannelFactory) - This project presents a WCF Stock Service Library (StockServiceLib) that mimics a stock exchange. The service is implemented as a “singleton” and maintains persistent data between client calls and can handle multiple client sessions. The service is hosted via a console application (StockServiceHost). The client and service participate in a bi-directional/callback relationship. The client (StockClient) uses the ChannelFactory pattern as opposed to “Add Service Reference” with SVCUTIL. The client and service share a common assembly (SharedLib) that contains the key contract and data model information. Furthermore, a Utilities project is used by the client console application to facilitate user data entry and the complicated details of building and managing the WCF ChannelFactory connection implementation. The ProxyGen class inside the Utilities project abstracts the details of implementing and managing a generic ChannelFactory connection to a generic service for a client. Note: The Utilities project library was included as base code for my lab project to facilitate speedy completion; we were not expected to code this Utilities project ourselves due to complexity and time constraints. The remaining projects in the solution (SharedLib, StockClient, StockServiceHost, and StockServiceLib), I completed individually per requirements for the lab project.

This information may help you improving your build times and build sizes. This script allows you to inspect this information graphically in the Editor UI, making it more easily accessible than the script APIs would.You can obtain a BuildReport object as the return value of the BuildPlayer API (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer.html) when making a build, or by selecting a file containing BuildReport data.Unitys default build setup will write such a file to Library/LastBuild.buildreport (this may change in the future) when making a build. This script adds a convenient menu shortcut (Window/Open Last Build Report), to copy that file to the Assets folder and select it, so you can inspect it using the Build Report Inspector.Once open in the inspector, you can chose what data to view using the popup menu at the top of the window.

I also plan on rewriting some of the code, as I'm currently not happy with some of my implementation. I plan to use this for a game I wish to create in the future.
